In contemporary virtualized data center 
environments, efficient resource allocation in virtualized data 
center environments is crucial for preventing server downtimes. 
This paper introduces a method to mitigate resource exhaustion 
on ESXi servers using predictive analytics. Leveraging 
historical workload data, the proposed approach forecasts 
potential resource saturation events by analyzing past usage 
patterns. A proactive provisioning mechanism is outlined to 
deploy virtual machines (VMs) onto new ESXi servers during 
predicted high-load intervals. This preemptive strategy 
strategically distributes workloads, averting server downtime 
and ensuring optimal resource utilization. Experimental results 
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving 
the dependability and security of ESXi servers in virtualized 
environments and out performs better than other state-of-arts. 
The proposed method is implemented using ESXi host client and 
the result shows effective performance and improved stability of 
the overall system.
